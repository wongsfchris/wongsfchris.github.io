                <h2>Interest</h2>
                <p>I like numbers, as every number represents something. somewhere. someone. You can mix it up, 
                    and the patterns that you can generate with numbers are endless. 
                </p>So it is only natural that I got myself studying accounting. 

                <p> I also grew up being very fascinated with computers and the things I can do with it. 
                    I built a webpage using geocities (oh-oh, age-reveal) for the girl guides at my school. I learnt about 
                    IF THEN ELSE only in college, and it blew my mind to know that's how machines work. Programming.  
                </p>
                <p> I studied my degree in both accounting and IT. </p>
            </div>

                <h2>Career</h2>
                <p>Had the best time working in IBM Malaysia. Joined as a fresh graduate, and was placed into the consulting
                    department, and picked up SAP. Several years later, I studied for my CPA part time and was granted CPA status
                    thereafter. 

                </p>
                <p>Career progression led me to be a project manager, and several years later, 
                    got my PMP certification too.</p> 

                <p>After being too comfortable in the SAP space, I decided to venture out to do data science. So here I am now :D 
                </p>
